        <h1>Meet the Team</h1>
        
        <p><strong>It takes a well-oiled machine to create a potion shop in this day and age, and our Arcana and Glass simply cannot exist wtihout the team members working night and day to make your magic brews possible, so let's introduce them right from the start.</strong></p>
        <h2>Maelin Thorne: Huntress</h2>
        <p>A master tracker with preternatural senses tuned to the boundaries between the mortal world and the arcane. Maelin specializes in safely retrieving ingredients from magical creatures — shed scales, molted feathers, nocturnal nectar — without harming them.</p>
        <p>How does she help? Maelin navigates dangerous terrain, identifies creature patterns, and protects the crew from anything with sharp teeth and sharper magic. </p>
        <h2>Mirka "Quill" Dath: Cartographer</h2>
        <p>A wanderer who maps ley lines, magically charged caverns, and the invisible trails that lead to ingredient-rich locations.</p>
        <p>How does she help? Mirka locates the safest (or at least most interesting) paths to areas of magical density. Uses crystalline instruments to predict storms, rifts, and moments when ingredients are at peak potency.</p>
        <h2>Nareth Coalshadow: Beast-Mediator</h2>
        <p>Descended from a long line of “creature diplomats,” Nareth knows how to negotiate with beasts, both sentient and semi-sentient. He speaks in low tones, subtle gestures, and the occasional raw fish.</p>
        <p>How does he help? Nareth calms territorial guardians, handles creatures that mistake the crew for snacks, and helps collect ingredients from beings that cooperate… reluctantly.</p>

        <h2>Livadi Ceas: Archivist of Forgotten Brews and Keeper of Arcane Lineage</h2>
        <p>I'm Livadi, and while I may be the face you see most often here at Arcana & Glass, I still think of myself simply as a student of old stories. My work revolves around piecing together the histories of long-lost potions — fragments of recipes, half-remembered rituals, and the occasional scrawled warning left by an alchemist who clearly knew more than I currently do</p>
        <p>I keep our records, maps, and journals up to date… or at least as close to “up to date” as traveling through magical wilderness allows. My pack is usually heavy with notes from ancient tomes, sketches of runes I'm still trying to decipher, and a list of places where certain ingredients were rumored to grow. A rumor, after all, is just a story waiting to be proven true.</p>
        <p>How do I help? Most of the potions we pursue haven't been brewed in centuries. My role is to trace their origins, gather whatever scraps of information survive, and narrow down where we should begin searching. I don't always have exact answers, but I can usually point our team toward the right forest, cavern, coastline, or creature — and I'm always ready to revise my notes when reality proves me wrong (which happens more often than I care to admit).</p>

        <h1>Take a Look at Some of Our Explorations</h1>
        <h3>Our Cartographer, Quill, keeps a sharp eye as we trek into the unknown, keeping a close eye on our location and the atmosphere of the wild. One of our most memorable recordings occured in the misted forests of the Northern Reaches. Here's just a piece of Quill's beautiful notes:</h3>
        <p class="fieldnote">Field Note, Entry 27:</p>
<p class="fieldnote">The misted forests of the northern reaches continue to demonstrate an unusual balance between serenity and latent hazard. At first light, the fog rises in low, rolling currents, diffusing sound and rendering even the slightest movement strangely amplified. It is within this quiet that most alchemical flora thrive; the stillness allows delicate spores and luminescent mosses to remain undisturbed long enough to mature.</p>

<p class="fieldnote">Travel, however, demands a measured pace. Beneath the tranquility lies a network of creatures and old enchantments that do not take kindly to careless intrusion. Subtle shifts in the mist — a sudden thinning, or the way it pools around certain roots — often signal territory best avoided. </p>

<p class="fieldnote">Yet, for those patient enough to study its rhythms, the forest reveals an almost meditative beauty. Each step becomes both inquiry and respect, a reminder that true discovery often resides in the hush between heartbeats.</p>
