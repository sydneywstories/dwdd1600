        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to Arcana and Glass!</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Livadi, the local apothecary here at the Elderbough Province. We at Arcana and Glass
            focus not
            only on the creation of the mysterious healing and monstrous results, but also on the very essence of the
            storytelling behind each of our bottles of wonder. Take a look at our shelves and you’ll find not only a
            magical substance worthy of curing whatever ailment or desire you may need, but the stories behind them to
            prove it. Follow our crew, consisting of our huntress, cartographer, beast-mediator, and other specialists
            in each narrative showing the magical past behind our brews. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
